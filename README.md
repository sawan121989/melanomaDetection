## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## Conclusions
- The model was Underfitting initially due to class imbalance
- Class imbalance was solved by adding 500 samples to each class using Augmentor library
- 80 percent accuracy was observed after solving class imbalance


## Technologies Used
- pandas, numpy, tensoflow, keras
- matplotlib
- Augmentor


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by Course in ML and AI from IIITB and Upgrad
